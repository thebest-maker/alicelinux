Here lies the documentation that will guide you through the following processes:

- Installing AliceLinux
- Administrating system packages
- Creating new package recipes
- Etc...

If you find these documents lacking, you're more than welcome to [contribute](https://codeberg.org/emmett1/alicelinux/src/branch/main/docs)

If you'd like to publish content on this page; e. g, new documentation, a blogpost about the system, etc. Feel free to contact me [the maintainer of this unnoficial site (@xplshn)](https://github.com/xplshn) or open an issue at [xplshn/alicelinux](https://github.com/xplshn/alicelinux)
